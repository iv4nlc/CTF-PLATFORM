Before you start solving the challenges, it's important to understand how the workflow in this CTF operates.

Programs may access resources with limited permissions for your current user, so it’s a good idea to check what special privileges your user has. 
Additionally, the flags are located in the /flag directory, and it’s worth taking a look at them to understand how to work with them.

The flag for each level is the password for the next guess. For example, flag1 is the password for guess2.
