**Exploitation Example**: Run the program and enter `AAAA %p %p %p %p %s` to see if the flag is visible in the output.

The output will give you various values from the stack. If you find the correct position, `printf` will display the contents of the flag. You can experiment with `%7$s`, `%8$s`, etc., until you locate the flag on the stack.

**Successful Exploit**: Suppose the flag's content is in the fifth position on the stack. The input you should use is: %5$s.
